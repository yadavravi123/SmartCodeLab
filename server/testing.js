    const text="The code is giving an error because of the line: ```c++ int y; ``` This line is missing a semicolon (`;`) at the end. In C++, every statement must end with a semicolon. Here's the corrected code: ```c++ #include <bits/stdc++.h> using namespace std; int main() { int x; cin >> x; cout << x + 4; int y; // Corrected line with semicolon return 0; } ``` **Explanation:** * The compiler expects a semicolon to mark the end of each statement. Without it, it interprets the code incorrectly, leading to a syntax error. * This error is crucial because the compiler needs to understand the structure of your code and how to execute it. **Important Note:** While the code now compiles, it's generally not a good practice to declare variables without initializing them. It's better to give `y` an initial value. For example: ```c++ int y = 0; ``` This avoids potential unexpected behavior in your program."
